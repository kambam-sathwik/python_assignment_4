🔹 Task 1: File Reading with Exception Handling

This Python program attempts to read the contents of a file named sample.txt. It reads all lines from the file and displays them line by line with line numbers. The program uses exception handling to gracefully handle the case where the file does not exist, displaying an appropriate error message instead of crashing.

🔹 Task 2: File Writing, Appending, and Reading

This Python program demonstrates complete file handling operations in Python:

Writes user-entered text to a file named output.txt

Appends additional text to the same file

Reads and displays the final contents of the file

It illustrates the use of different file modes (write, append, and read) and shows how data can be safely stored and retrieved from a text file.
